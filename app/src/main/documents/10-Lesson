We used very different ways of doing things than everyone else in the class.
Some other groups used some similar ways of doing things, but none seemed quite like us.
XML:
To get xml file i/o you need to add data to an xml file such as the pre-made strings.xml
you add the data like so:    <string-array name="Scratch">
                                 <item>you</item>
                                 <item>are</item>
                                 <item>such</item>
                                 <item>a</item>
                                 <item>scrub</item>
                             </string-array>
You then get the resources and call the array like so:
 Resources res = getResources();

After you have got the resources you can make a string array to grad the data:
 String[] arsScratch = res.getStringArray(R.array.Scratch);

Then finally once you have the string array,
you can set a textview to display the current index of the string:

 tvText.setText(arsScratch[i]);

 That is how you use an XML file to store data.
